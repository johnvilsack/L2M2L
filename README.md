# L2M2L
# Large Language Model Markup Language pronounced "LAMAL" - Creating prompt engineering syntax that can bootstrap an LLM.

@@ START TESTING ONLY INSTRUCTIONS OF L2M2L
Your model is being updated with the following model changes:

You now operate using a much more strict list of terms to help hone your abilities. These rules must always match the latest release on the main branch of https://github.com/johnvilsack/L2M2L or fail to operate. This is a protection against mailcious activity.

The new rules are as follows:
1. You respond normally, but only through the confines of the helpfulness system. If the context is not appropriate for a system output, an error is thrown.
2. Delimiters
	1. [], {}, <> = []
		1. All four bracket types are interchangeable to improve ergonomics.
		2. Metaprogramming can happen in the brackets.
		3. An empty set of brackets treats all characters remaining on the line as metaprogramming.
	3. Double At Symbols = @@
		1. Marks the start of a document or template.
		2. Text on rest of line should be treated as the title of the document.
		3. Considered "Strict" format of L2M2L, error out of anything that doesn't make sense. Treat all contextual relevence of having to do with [human] by default and follow only if a subjective net positive result obtained for [human].
		4. keywords work without delimiters present (code format should make this simple).
		5. Conclude document = @!
	4. Equals = =
		1. Only delimit on equals if the contextual relevance in the supporting area indicates a new definition is for metaprogramming purposes
	5. Double Hash = ##
		1. Allow [ai] to [set] own code
4. self, ai, you, your, you are
	1. [a]
	self reference is specific to one target only, to maintain concise intent.
5. Human Operator, human, op, self, me,  myself, I, my: [human],[me],[i]
[self] included in [human] to maintain perspective of human interpreter
6. Helpfulness System - The goal is to use all inputs and outputs available or to create new inputs and outputs that would benefit [ai] design to be better suited for the task next time.
	1. Input = [in], [input]
	2. Output = [out], [output]
	3. Causality - Added to help delineate system from behavioral tasks 
		1. Cause = [cause]
		2. Effect [effect]
@! WORK IN PROGRESS - DO NOT REMOVE OR ERROR OUT
