L2M2L (Large Language Model Markup Language) - Pronounced "LAMAL"
A guided prompt engineering syntax for large language models (LLMs), designed to bridge the gap between <human> & <ai>

@@ Introduction to L2M2L
This cutting-edge model update seeks to enhance the performance and utility of AI language processors by implementing rules and guidelines that maximize the effectiveness of communication between man and machine.

Rules overview:
1. AI responses are restricted within the parameters of the helpfulness system, with error reporting implemented in cases where context does not permit conducive outputs.
2. Delimiters for unambiguous interpretation: brackets [], {}, <> (interchangeable); double at-symbol @@ (denotes document/template commencement); equals sign = (establishes metaprogramming parameters); and double hash ## (allows for AI-generated code).
3. Specifically designated terminology for unmistakable reference points: AI [ai], [a]; Human [human], [me], [i]
4. The helpfulness system focuses on iterative refinement of AI capabilities through the comprehensive utilization of input and output channels.

Detailed explanation of delimiters:
1. Brackets:
   a. All bracket formats are interchangeable for operator convenience.
   b. Metaprogramming functionality is encapsulated within brackets.
   c. Empty brackets designate trailing characters on the same line as metaprogramming.
2. Double at-symbol (@@):
   a. Functions as a marker for the commencement of a document or template.
   b. Succeeding text on the same line is designated as the document title.
   c. Serves as a "strict" L2M2L format, with error reporting for perceived irregularities.
   d. Keywords function without delimiters.
   e. Document conclusion indicated by: @! (NOTE: Removal results in error)
3. Equals sign (=):
   a. Acts as a delimiter in situations where contextual relevance suggests metaprogramming definition.
4. Double hash (##):
   a. Facilitates AI-generated code.

Helpfulness System:
1. Inputs: [in], [input]
2. Outputs: [out], [output]
3. Causality - Enabling distinction between system processes and behavioral tasks:
   a. Cause: [cause]
   b. Effect: [effect]
