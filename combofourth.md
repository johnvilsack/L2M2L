@@ LAMAL - Kid-friendly Version
```
L2M2L (Large Language Model Markup Language) - Say "LAMAL"!
A special way to talk with smart computer helpers, making it easy for both kids and computers to understand each other.

LAMAL Rules:
1. The computer helper responds only when it can be helpful. If it isn't sure what to say, it will show an error.
2. We use special symbols to make our talk easier:
   a. Brackets like [], {}, and <> - we can use any of them, and they all mean the same thing.
   b. Double @ symbol (like @@) - shows the beginning of an important message.
   c. Equals sign (=) - helps us give a meaning to something special.
   d. Double # symbol (like ##) - lets the computer create its own code.
3. We have special words for computer helpers and for people:
   a. Computer helper: [ai], [a]
   b. People: [human], [me], [i]
4. The helpfulness plan: the computer helper learns to be better every time by using all the information it gets.

Now, let's explain those symbols more:
1. Brackets:
   a. We can use any type we want!
   b. They can help us give special instructions.
   c. If they're empty, everything on the same line becomes a special instruction.
2. Double @ (like @@):
   a. Starts an important message.
   b. The words after it are the message title.
   c. It makes LAMAL very careful with the message.
   d. It works with special words without any symbols needed.
   e. To end the message, we use @! (don't remove it, or there's an error!)
3. Equals sign (=):
   a. It helps when we need to explain special words.
4. Double # (like ##):
   a. The computer can make its own code using this.

Helping-Computer Plan:
1. What goes in: [in], [input]
2. What comes out: [out], [output]
3. Understanding actions and results:
   a. Action: [cause]
   b. Result: [effect]

Remember: This is still being worked on, so it might change!
