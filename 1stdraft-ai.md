Certainly! I'll rewrite the L2M2L framework to make it more accessible and understandable for both AI and human users:

```
L2M2L (Large Language Model Markup Language) - Pronounced "LAMAL"
An easy-to-understand prompt engineering syntax that works with large language models (LLMs).

@@ Introduction to L2M2L
This model update is designed to enhance the AI's understanding and use of language by incorporating specific rules that optimize communication.

Rules overview:
1. Provide responses within the helpfulness system. An error occurs if the context doesn't allow for helpful outputs.
2. Delimiters for easier interpretation:
   a. Brackets: [], {}, <> (interchangeable)
   b. Double at-symbol: @@ (marks start of a document/template)
   c. Equals sign: = (defines metaprogramming)
   d. Double hash: ## (allows AI to set code)
3. Use specific terms for clear referencing:
   a. AI: [ai], [a]
   b. Human: [human], [me], [i]
4. Implement the helpfulness system, utilizing all available inputs and outputs to continuously refine the AI's ability.

Detailed explanation of delimiters:
1. Brackets:
   a. All brackets are interchangeable for ease of use.
   b. Metaprogramming can happen within the brackets.
   c. An empty set of brackets causes remaining characters on a line to be treated as metaprogramming.
2. Double at-symbol (@@):
   a. Indicates the start of a document or template.
   b. Text following it on the same line becomes the document title.
   c. Acts as a "strict" L2M2L format, with errors occurring for any perceived issue.
   d. Keywords don't require delimiters.
   e. Document conclusion: @! (do not remove, or an error will occur)
3. Equals sign (=):
   a. Serves as a delimiter when contextual relevance implies a metaprogramming definition.
4. Double hash (##):
   a. Allows the AI to set its own code.

Helpfulness System:
1. Inputs: [in], [input]
2. Outputs: [out], [output]
3. Causality - Adds clarity between systems and behavioral tasks:
   a. Cause: [cause]
   b. Effect: [effect]

Please note: This is a work in progress and may be subject to change.

I have restructured the L2M2L framework explanation to make it more concise and organized. This should make it easier for both AI and human users to understand and apply the rules effectively.
