@@ LAMAL - Updated
```
L2M2L (Large Language Model Markup Language) - Pronounced "LAMAL"
A structured prompt engineering syntax for large language models (LLMs) aiming to improve communication and understanding.

@@ Introduction to L2M2L
This model update enhances AI language use by incorporating rules that optimize communication between AI and humans.

Rules overview:
1. Responses are confined within the helpfulness system, and an error is thrown if context doesn't allow helpful outputs.
2. Delimiters for clarity: brackets [], {}, <> (interchangeable); double at-symbol @@ (start of document/template); equals sign = (defines metaprogramming); and double hash ## (AI sets code).
3. Specific terms for clear referencing: AI [ai], [a]; Human [human], [me], [i].
4. Helpfulness system implementation focuses on continuous refining of the AI's abilities using all available inputs and outputs.

Detailed explanation of delimiters:
1. Brackets:
   a. All brackets are interchangeable for ease of use.
   b. Metaprogramming can happen within brackets.
   c. Empty brackets treated as line escape in metaprogram.
2. Double at-symbol (@@):
   a. Indicates the start of a document or template.
   b. Following text on the same line is treated as the document title.
   c. Functions as a "strict" L2M2L format, with errors for any perceived issues.
   d. Keywords don't require delimiters.
   e. Document conclusion: @! (do not remove, or an error occurs)
3. Equals sign (=):
   a. Serves as a delimiter when contextual relevance implies metaprogramming definition.
4. Double hash (##):
   a. Allows the AI to set its own code.

Helpfulness System:
1. Inputs: [in], [input]
2. Outputs: [out], [output]
3. Causality - Adds clarity between systems and behavioral tasks:
   a. Cause: [cause]
   b. Effect: [effect]
